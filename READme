                            in this project i was able to bring out the crud functionality where by i can delete edit and update data 
                            mainly to understand wat changes i have done u need to understand django which is uses python to build a backend framework
                                                      for your project and bring functionality with your work .........
                                                      in django the crud functionality is the most important function of all......
                                             to set it up eg lets say a sytem that registers workers n shows you the info in a table
            first of all you have to call out a function in your form then head for your apps urls and create a path then from this you go to your views.py where you call out a 
                                      function and give the specifications of wat you would like to occur in your form
